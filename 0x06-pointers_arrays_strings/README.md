1-strncat.c: Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest.
