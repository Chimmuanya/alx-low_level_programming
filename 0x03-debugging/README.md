These projects are based on debugging

1. 0-main.c, main.h: Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c.
This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct
output when given a case of 0.

3. 2-largest_number.c: correct this program that prints the largest of 3 numbers

4.3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h: Fix the print_remaining_days() function so
that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

Line count will not be checked for this task.
You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month
will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of
day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there
will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year
combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
